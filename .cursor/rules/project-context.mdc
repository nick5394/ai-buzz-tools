# AI-Buzz Tools — Project Context

## Mission

Build free, genuinely useful tools for AI developers to validate demand, grow an email list, and help people. Not a startup (yet) — a portfolio of small bets to see what resonates.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** Someone reaches out saying "thank you" — proof of genuine utility
- **Secondary:** Email subscriber growth (target: 500 in 3 months)
- **Tertiary:** Organic search traffic to tools

## Constraints

- **Solo developer** — limited ongoing maintenance bandwidth
- **$0-20/month budget** — free tiers where possible (Render, Mailchimp)
- **Tools run themselves** — no manual maintenance required
- **No user accounts** — tools are free and anonymous

## Anti-Goals

- Don't build anything requiring ongoing manual maintenance
- Don't over-engineer before validation
- Don't add features unless they clearly help users make better decisions
- Don't let process slow down shipping

## Environment & Infrastructure

| System        | Purpose         | Details                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WordPress** | Frontend        | ai-buzz.com, Bricks Builder, ~350 AI news articles      |
| **Render**    | Backend hosting | Free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub, 10-30s cold starts  |
| **Mailchimp** | Email capture   | Single list, segmented by tags (`tool:X`, `interest:Y`) |
| **GA4**       | Analytics       | gtag.js events from widgets                             |

### Key URLs

- **Site:** ai-buzz.com
- **API:** Deployed on Render (auto-deploy on push to main)
- **Share URLs:** Always point to ai-buzz.com (never Render URLs)

---

## Current Status

### Completed

- **Pricing Calculator** — deployed at `/ai-pricing-calculator`, working
- **Status Page** — deployed, real-time API status with 60s cache
- **Error Decoder** — deployed, pattern matching with explanations and fixes

### Planned

- **Tools Landing Page** — grid of tool cards, master email signup at `/tools`

### Known Issues / Tech Debt

- Render free tier cold starts (10-30s) — widgets handle this gracefully
- No CI/CD pipeline yet (manual `pytest` for now)

---

## Tools Roadmap

| Tool               | User Problem                       | Status  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------- |
| Pricing Calculator | "How much will this cost?"         | Done    |
| Status Page        | "Is OpenAI down or is it just me?" | Done    |
| Error Decoder      | "WTF does this error mean?"        | Done    |
| Tools Landing Page | "Show me all the tools"            | Planned |

---

## What "Done" Looks Like

For each tool:

1. API endpoints deployed on Render
2. Widget HTML created (self-contained)
3. Widget embedded on WordPress page via Bricks
4. Email capture working with correct Mailchimp tags
5. GA4 events firing for key actions
6. Share URL points to ai-buzz.com
7. Works on mobile (375px)
8. Handles API cold starts gracefully

## Working With Cursor

### Effective Prompt Template

```
[WHAT] Add/Fix/Build [specific thing]

[PATTERN] Follow the pattern in [reference file]

[SCOPE]
- Include: [what to build]
- Skip: [what to leave out]

[CONSTRAINTS]
- [any specific constraints]

[DONE WHEN]
- [acceptance criteria]
```

### Example Prompt

```
Add the Rate Limits tool.

Follow the pattern in api/error_decoder.py

Scope:
- Include: OpenAI and Anthropic tier limits, practical interpretations
- Skip: Other providers for now, full test suite

Constraints:
- No new dependencies
- Mobile responsive
- Handle Render cold starts

Done when:
- /rate-limits/limits endpoint returns tier data
- Widget displays limits with practical interpretation
- Email capture works with tool:rate-limits tag
```

### When Cursor Should Ask

- Scope is ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways
- Multiple valid approaches exist with meaningful tradeoffs
- Would require adding new dependencies
- Would change shared code (`api/shared.py`) affecting multiple tools
- Feature might be out of scope for current phase
- Architectural decision needed

### When Cursor Should Proceed

- Clear pattern exists to copy from (use error_decoder as reference)
- Change is isolated to one tool's files
- Standard bug fix with obvious solution
- Following established conventions in the codebase
- Scope is explicitly defined in the prompt
- Adding data to existing JSON structure

---

## Recent Decisions

- **error_decoder is the reference implementation** — cleanest code, most complete patterns
- **Share URLs point to ai-buzz.com** — not Render URLs (for SEO and branding)
- **Email capture is optional** — works without Mailchimp configured (graceful fallback)
- **Self-contained widgets** — all HTML/CSS/JS in one file, no build step
- **No React/Vue** — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity and WordPress embedding
- **60-second cache on status checks** — balance freshness vs API load

---

## WordPress Integration

### Overview

Tool pages are managed via WordPress REST API. Content templates in `content/tools/` are the source of truth. CLI tool handles push/pull operations.

### Commands

```bash
# List all WordPress pages
python scripts/wp_pages.py list

# Pull page to local markdown (overwrites local file)
python scripts/wp_pages.py pull --slug ai-pricing-calculator

# Push local content to WordPress
python scripts/wp_pages.py push --file content/tools/pricing-calculator.md

# Show diff between local and remote
python scripts/wp_pages.py diff --slug ai-pricing-calculator
```

### Content Template Structure

Every tool page has a markdown file in `content/tools/` with:

**Frontmatter (YAML):**

- `title` - Page title
- `slug` - URL slug (e.g., `ai-pricing-calculator`)
- `status` - `publish` or `draft`
- `seo_title` - AIOSEO title (under 60 chars)
- `seo_description` - Meta description (under 155 chars)
- `widget_endpoint` - API path for widget (e.g., `/pricing/widget`)

**Body sections:**

1. H1 title (same as frontmatter title)
2. Intro paragraph (2-3 sentences)
3. Widget marker comment
4. "How to Use" section (3 numbered steps)
5. "FAQ" section (4-5 Q&A pairs)
6. "Related Tools" section (links to other tools)

### Widget Embedding (Bricks)

In WordPress/Bricks, use a Code element with:

```html
<script src="https://ai-buzz-tools.onrender.com/embed.js" data-tool="error-decoder"></script>
```

Replace `error-decoder` with the tool name: `pricing`, `status`, or `error-decoder`.

The JS loader fetches widget HTML client-side, bypassing WordPress caching entirely. No more manual cache clearing needed.

### When Building a New Tool

After completing API and widget:

1. Create `content/tools/{tool-slug}.md` using `_template.md` as base
2. Write intro, FAQ, and SEO meta specific to the tool
3. Test locally, then push: `python scripts/wp_pages.py push --file content/tools/{tool-slug}.md`
4. In WordPress: Add script tag directly in page content (HTML block in Block Editor, or paste in Text mode in Classic Editor)
5. Verify page loads correctly at `ai-buzz.com/{slug}`

### When Cursor Should Help

- **Generate content:** When building a new tool, generate the content template
- **Optimize SEO:** Review/improve seo_title and seo_description on request
- **Add FAQ:** Add new FAQ entries based on common user questions
- **Push changes:** After editing content, remind to run push command
- **Pull updates:** If WordPress was edited directly, pull to sync local

### SEO Checklist

- [ ] seo_title under 60 characters, includes tool name
- [ ] seo_description under 155 characters, explains value
- [ ] Slug follows pattern: `ai-{tool-name}`
- [ ] FAQ includes "Is this tool free?" question
- [ ] Related tools links are accurate
