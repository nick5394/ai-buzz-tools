# Project Status

## Mission

Build free, genuinely useful tools for AI developers to validate demand, grow an email list, and help people.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary:** Someone reaches out saying "thank you"
- **Secondary:** Email subscriber growth (target: 500 in 3 months)
- **Tertiary:** Organic search traffic to tools

## Constraints

- Solo developer — limited maintenance bandwidth
- $0-20/month budget — free tiers (Render, Mailchimp)
- Tools run themselves — no manual maintenance required
- No user accounts — tools are free and anonymous

## Current Status

### Completed

| Tool | URL | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| Pricing Calculator | `/ai-pricing-calculator` | Done |
| Status Page | `/ai-status` | Done |
| Error Decoder | `/ai-error-decoder` | Done |

### Planned

| Tool | User Problem | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| Tools Landing Page | "Show me all the tools" | Planned |

## Infrastructure

| System | Purpose | Details |
|--------|---------|---------|
| WordPress | Frontend | ai-buzz.com, Bricks Builder |
| Render | Backend hosting | Free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub |
| Mailchimp | Email capture | Single list, segmented by tags |
| GA4 | Analytics | gtag.js events from widgets |

### Key URLs

- **Site:** ai-buzz.com
- **API:** Deployed on Render (auto-deploy on push to main)
- **Share URLs:** Always point to ai-buzz.com (never Render URLs)

## What "Done" Looks Like

For each tool:

1. API endpoints deployed on Render
2. Widget HTML created (self-contained)
3. Widget embedded on WordPress page via Bricks
4. Email capture working with correct Mailchimp tags
5. GA4 events firing for key actions
6. Share URL points to ai-buzz.com
7. Works on mobile (375px)
8. Handles API cold starts gracefully

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

- Render free tier cold starts (10-30s) — widgets handle gracefully
- No CI/CD pipeline yet (manual `pytest` for now)
