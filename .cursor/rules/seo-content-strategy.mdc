# SEO & Content Quality Strategy

This rule enforces strict content quality standards for all pages in `content/tools/`. The goal is to publish only high-quality content that ranks in search and provides genuine value to AI developers.

**Philosophy:** It's better to have 5 excellent pages than 15 mediocre ones. Quality over quantity.

---

## TIER 1: STOP AND CHECK — Before Creating Any New Page

Before creating a new content page, you MUST answer these questions. If you can't answer them clearly, DO NOT create the page.

### Search Intent Validation

1. **What specific query is someone typing to find this?**
   - Must be a real search query, not marketing-speak
   - Example: "openai 429 error fix" (good) vs "API Excellence Guide" (bad)

2. **What is the search intent?**
   - Informational: "what are openai rate limits"
   - Troubleshooting: "openai 429 error python"
   - Comparison: "openai vs anthropic pricing"
   - Transactional: "openai api pricing calculator"

3. **What answer are they hoping to find?**
   - Be specific. "How to fix the error" is too vague.
   - "Working Python code with exponential backoff that handles 429 errors" is specific.

4. **What makes this page better than the top 3 Google results?**
   - If you can't articulate this, don't create the page.
   - "We have a widget" is not enough. The content must also be superior.

### Duplication Check

Before creating, search existing content:

- Does another page already target this query?
- Would this cannibalize an existing page's rankings?
- Should this be a section in an existing page instead?

**If >50% content would overlap with an existing page, DO NOT create a new page. Expand the existing one.**

## TIER 2: Content Depth Requirements

### Minimum Standards by Page Type

| Page Type | Min Lines | Required Elements |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Tool page (widget-focused) | 100+ | Widget, How to Use (3 steps), FAQ (5+ questions), Related Tools (3-5 links) |
| Guide page (content-focused) | 200+ | Code examples (2+), troubleshooting steps, common mistakes section, FAQ (5+) |
| Comparison page | 150+ | Comparison table, specific numbers, "when to choose X" sections, real-world cost examples |

### Required Sections for ALL Pages

1. **Title (H1)** — Must target the primary search query
2. **Intro paragraph** — 2-3 sentences explaining the problem and who this is for
3. **Widget embed** — If applicable
4. **Substantive body content** — NOT just template boilerplate
5. **FAQ section** — Minimum 5 questions, including "Is this tool free?"
6. **Related Tools** — 3-5 internal links with descriptive anchor text

### What "Substantive" Means

Content is substantive if it includes AT LEAST ONE of:

- Working code examples (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Comparison tables with real numbers
- Step-by-step troubleshooting guides
- Real-world cost calculations or scenarios
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them

**Template boilerplate does NOT count as substantive.** The FAQ and Related Tools sections alone do not make a page valuable.

---

## TIER 3: When NOT to Publish

STOP and reconsider if:

- [ ] Page is under 100 lines (tool pages) or 200 lines (guides)
- [ ] No clear search query being targeted
- [ ] Content is mostly template sections (How to Use + FAQ + Related)
- [ ] Just duplicating official documentation without adding unique value
- [ ] No code examples, tables, or practical guidance
- [ ] Another page already covers this topic adequately
- [ ] You can't articulate why someone would choose this over Google result #1

**When in doubt, don't publish. Expand an existing page instead.**

---

## TIER 4: SEO Technical Requirements

### Title and Meta

- `seo_title`: Under 60 characters, includes primary keyword
- `seo_description`: Under 155 characters, includes value proposition + keyword
- H1 must closely match the primary search query
- Slug format: `ai-{descriptive-slug}` (e.g., `ai-openai-429-errors`)

### Internal Linking

- Every page links OUT to 3-5 related tools/guides
- Every NEW page must be linked FROM at least 2 existing pages
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here" or "learn more")
- Example: "See [OpenAI Rate Limits by Tier](/ai-openai-rate-limits)" (good)

### URL Strategy

- All tool pages use `ai-` prefix for brand consistency
- Keep slugs short but descriptive
- Use hyphens, not underscores
- No dates in URLs (content should be evergreen)

---

## TIER 5: Content Freshness

### When to Update Existing Content

Update content when:

- New models are released (quarterly check)
- Pricing changes (update `data/pricing.json` AND relevant guide pages)
- Rate limit structures change
- Error patterns change

### Freshness Checklist (Run Quarterly)

- [ ] Are model names current? (no deprecated models like gpt-3.5-turbo-0301)
- [ ] Are pricing numbers accurate?
- [ ] Are rate limit tables current?
- [ ] Do code examples use current API patterns?

**Note:** This is a manual check, not an automated system. Run it when you remember or when major model releases happen.

---

## TIER 6: Consolidation and Deletion Rules

### When to Merge Pages

Merge pages when:

- >50% content overlap
- Targeting the same primary keyword
- One page is thin (<80 lines) and the other covers the topic better
- Search console shows both pages competing for same queries

**How to merge:**
1. Identify the stronger page (more content, better rankings)
2. Move unique content from weaker page to stronger page
3. Set up 301 redirect from old URL to new URL
4. Update all internal links pointing to old URL

### When to Delete Pages

Delete pages when:

- Under 80 lines with no unique value
- No search traffic after 3+ months
- Completely superseded by another page
- Just duplicating official documentation

**Before deleting:** Check if any unique content should be salvaged and moved elsewhere.

---

## Reference: Best-in-Class Content

Use [`ai-openai-429-errors.md`](../content/tools/ai-openai-429-errors.md) as the reference implementation. It has:

- **310 lines** of substantive content
- **Clear problem statement** in the intro
- **Multiple code examples** (Python with tenacity, manual retry, Node.js)
- **Common mistakes section** — practical, specific advice
- **Real troubleshooting steps** — not just "contact support"
- **FAQ with real questions** developers actually ask

All new guide content should aim for this level of depth.

---

## Content Audit: Current Pages

### Status: KEEP (High Quality)

| File | Lines | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `ai-openai-429-errors.md` | 310 | Reference implementation. Excellent depth. |
| `ai-pricing-calculator.md` | 187 | Good depth, comparison tables, real examples. |
| `ai-tools.md` | 83 | Landing page. Serves its purpose. |

### Status: EXPAND (Too Thin)

| File | Lines | Action Needed |
|------|-------|---------------|
| `ai-error-decoder.md` | 52 | Currently template-level. Add error examples, common patterns, provider-specific sections. Target 150+ lines. |
| `ai-status.md` | 144 | Good base. Absorb content from ai-is-openai-down.md. Add "Is OpenAI Down?" section at top. |

### Status: MERGED (Completed)

The following pages were consolidated:

- `ai-is-openai-down.md` → merged into `ai-status.md` (set up 301 redirect in WordPress)
- `ai-openai-errors.md` → merged into `ai-error-decoder.md` (set up 301 redirect in WordPress)

## Quality Checklist: Before Every Publish

Run this checklist before pushing any content to WordPress:

- [ ] **Search query identified** — Can state the exact query this targets
- [ ] **Intent matched** — Content answers what the searcher wants
- [ ] **Depth achieved** — Meets minimum line count for page type
- [ ] **Substantive content** — Has code, tables, or practical guidance (not just template)
- [ ] **No duplication** — Doesn't cannibalize existing pages
- [ ] **SEO meta complete** — seo_title (<60 chars), seo_description (<155 chars)
- [ ] **Internal links** — Links to 3-5 related pages, will be linked from 2+ pages
- [ ] **FAQ complete** — 5+ questions including "Is this tool free?"
- [ ] **Better than competitors** — Can articulate why this beats Google result #1

**If any checkbox fails, do not publish. Fix it first or reconsider whether this page should exist.**
